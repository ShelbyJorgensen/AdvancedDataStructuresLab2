# AdvancedDataStructuresLab2
This lab was created for my CS302 Advanced Data Structures class at Central Washington University. In this lab, we worked with tree rotations to get two tree to have identical structures. Below is the outline provided for this lab:

**Problem**
You are given two non-empty binary search tree T1 and T2. T1 and T2 store the same keys. The structure of
both trees, however, is different. Implement an algorithm that uses rotations on T1 to make it equivalent
to T2. That is, both trees should have identical structure. Note that you are only allowed to use rotations
and only on T1; you are not allowed to modify the trees in any other way. The implementation must be
iterative.
